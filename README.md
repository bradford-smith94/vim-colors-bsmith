# vim-colors-bsmith
My personal Vim colorscheme.

## Support
The bsmith colorscheme has automatic support for 8/16/256+ color terminals.
Simply specify the colorscheme once (`:colorscheme bsmith`) and it will automatically use the correct variant based on the number of colors available.

**Note**: The 8 and 16 color versions are compatibility only and most likely don't look very good.
